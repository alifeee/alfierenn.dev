[wwwww.who]
question = "am I?"
text = "Alfie Renn! I am UK-based, and currently living in Sheffield. I am an enthusiastic and experimental technophile, who loves to see what forces for good are possible using technology."
[wwwww.what]
question = "do I do?"
text = "I make websites, I make software, and I make good decisions. I know web fundamentals inside-out. As for tools, I use Eleventy, a robust and extendible static-site generator; I use Vue, a powerful front-end framework; and I use Python to supplement my work, with powerful scripting."
[wwwww.where]
question = "can you find me?"
text = "Usually around GitHub..! Or many more places across the web. But, your literal answer is... right here on this website!"
[wwwww.when]
question = "can I do what you want?"
text = "Likely soon! Send me an email â†’ <a href='mailto:alfie@alfierenn.dev'>alfie@alfierenn.dev</a>, and we can take it from there."
[wwwww.why]
question = "do I do what I do?"
text = "I love the Internet! I think it is such a great opportunity that we have it. I think the ability to make stuff that is easily shared on the web should be accessible to anyone and everyone, and respect this view when I make things for the Internet by making them as simple and robust as possible."
[wwwww.how]
question = "will I do what you want?"
text = "That depends entirely on what you want and what you have already. Let's talk about it and share ideas together :)"
